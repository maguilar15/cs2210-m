#### Define the problem/solution recursively (this is the most important step – if you don’t do this correctly, you will automatically get a 0 for the problem regardless of the code you write).

#### Briefly talk about how you plan to store solutions to sub-problems and combining them to solve the global problem (talk about the data structure/variables you’ll use to solve the problem).

stored in variable. 

#### Talk about how you used IDEAL and Duke 7 to tackle the problem

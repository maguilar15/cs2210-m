#### Define the problem/solution recursively (this is the most important step – if you don’t do this correctly, you will automatically get a 0 for the problem regardless of the code you write).

Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers.
This statement showed it would be a factorization problem depending on the product of the given integer. 

#### Briefly talk about how you plan to store solutions to sub-problems and combining them to solve the global problem (talk about the data structure/variables you’ll use to solve the problem).

Use a variable to store the result. This variable will be the maximum product you can get from **n**.
Looked at the sequence of numbers that have to be imitated. Noticed the commonality between each term and made conditionals in the code that enforce that behavior. 

#### Talk about how you used IDEAL and Duke 7 to tackle the problem

Focusing on the sequence of numbers you can tell you can make conditionals and update to variables because of the listed terms.

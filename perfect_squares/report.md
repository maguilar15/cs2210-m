#### Define the problem/solution recursively (this is the most important step – if you don’t do this correctly, you will automatically get a 0 for the problem regardless of the code you write).

Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers. This positive integer will be factorized into multiples of that number based on the conditions provided. 
The code must be able to handle these conditions in order to factorize correctly. 

#### Briefly talk about how you plan to store solutions to sub-problems and combining them to solve the global problem (talk about the data structure/variables you’ll use to solve the problem).

Using a variable that will hold a value until I break from the loop.
I had to use a recursive call to be able to update the number that will be compared in if statement.    
This number is what is returned to the user. 

#### Talk about how you used IDEAL and Duke 7 to tackle the problem

I first had to determine the conditionals I would need to make sure a number is a square. This was the first sub-problem. 
This sub-problem is combined in the end to a variable to return to the user.
